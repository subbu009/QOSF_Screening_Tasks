# QOSF_Screening_Tasks

Hello
I am Subrahmanyam Gantasala, and here I am presenting my solution for QOSF Mentorship Screening Task - Task2
The file named **QOSF_Task2_final.ipynb** contains the solution and file named **download.png** contains the circuit used for error detection and the correction
I used bit flip and sign flip error correcting codes

Thank you organisers for giving me this oppurtunity
Regards
Subrahanyam Gantasala
